            <p>GoGoFlorida.us was established in 2002 as a part of Treasures of the Caribbean International, focusing on consumer sales efforts in the Caribbean. </p>
            <p>Treasures of the Caribbean has been the General Sales Agent for Dollar Rent a Car since 1994 with an exclusive contract for the Bahamas, Jamaica, Bermuda, Turks & Caicos, and the Cayman Islands. </p>
            <p>Caribe Travel Marketing has been the Exclusive General Sales Agent for Dollar Rent a Car in the Eastern Caribbean, including the islands of Aruba, Trinidad & Tobago, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Martin, St. Maarten, St. Vincent, Barbados, Grenada, and Guadeloupe.</p>
            <p>GoGoFlorida.us is owned and operated by Vernon and Victoria Lindo, a family business with deep roots in the industry.</p>
            <p>The Lindo name has been associated with car rental for over 50 years. Lindo’s Rent a Car & Tours was established in Jamaica in 1966 by Don Lindo and the late Vernon Lindo, Sr. Ten years later, the family started Lindo’s Rent a Car in Florida, soon growing into one of the largest privately owned car rental agencies in the state. In Orlando, Florida – the largest rental market in the world – the Lindo’s fleet exceeded that of every other company, Hertz and Avis included. In 1991, Lindo’s Rent a Car was sold to Chrysler and merged into Dollar Rent a Car. “Lindo’s Drive” just off Sand Lake Road near Orlando International Airport was named in honor of the company at the site of their final location.</p>
            <p>Vernon Lindo started the voucher business in the Caribbean and the Bahamas and continues to serve the Caribbean traveler with drive and innovation. </p>
